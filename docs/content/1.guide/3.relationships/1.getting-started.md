# Getting started

Relationship management is the key strength of Pinia ORM. By defining relationships, Pinia ORM uses the relationships you define to construct data when storing, modifying, and fetching from Pinia Store.

## Defining Relationships

Relationships are defined as a field in your model classes. They use relationship attributes such as `hasOne` and `hasMany`. Pinia ORM supports many types of relationships you'd expect from an ORM. In our example below we define a "One to Many" relationship between the `User` model and the `Post` model:

```js
class User extends Model {
  static entity = 'users'

  static fields () {
    return {
      id: this.attr(null),
      name: this.string(''),
      posts: this.hasMany(Post, 'userId')
    }
  }
}

class Post extends Model {
  static entity = 'posts'

  static fields () {
    return {
      id: this.attr(null),
      userId: this.attr(null),
      title: this.string('')
    }
  }
}
```

Pinia ORM provides a variety of relationship attributes. Please see corresponding documentation to learn how to define the relationships you would like to construct.

- [One to One](/guide/relationships/one-to-one.md)
- [One to Many](/guide/relationships/one-to-many.md)

### Composite Key support

The relations `hasOne`, `belongsTo` & `hasMany` are also supporting composite keys if you have models with combined primary key.
So you can define something like this:
```js
class User extends Model {
  static entity = 'users'

  static primaryKey = ['id', 'secondId']

  static fields () {
    return {
      id: this.attr(null),
      secondId: this.attr(null),
      name: this.string(''),
      posts: this.hasMany(Post, ['userId', 'userSecondId'])
    }
  }
}

class Post extends Model {
  static entity = 'posts'

  static fields () {
    return {
      id: this.attr(null),
      userId: this.attr(null),
      userSecondId: this.attr(null),
      title: this.string('')
    }
  }
}
```

## Loading Relationships

Relationships must be "eagerly loaded" by adding the `with(...)` method to your repository's query chain. For example, let's say your `User` model has the following relationship to the `Post` model:

```js
class User extends Model {
  static entity = 'users'

  static fields () {
    return {
      id: this.attr(null),
      name: this.string(''),
      posts: this.hasMany(Post, 'userId')
    }
  }
}

class Post extends Model {
  static entity = 'posts'

  static fields () {
    return {
      id: this.attr(null),
      body: this.string(''),
      userId: this.attr(null),
    }
  }
}
```

To retrieve the `User` model with any related `Post`, you chain the `with('posts')` method to your query. The argument `posts` is the key name where the relationship is defined.

```js
const user = useRepo(User).with('posts').first()

/*
  {
    id: 1,
    name: 'John Doe',
    posts: [
      { id: 1, userId: 1, title: '...' },
      { id: 2, userId: 1, title: '...' }
    ]
  }
*/
```

Of course, you may chain more than one `with(...)` method to retrieve multiple relationships.

```js
const user = useRepo(User).with('posts').with('phone').first()
```

### Loading Nested Relationships

To load nested relationships, you may pass constraints to the 2nd argument. For example, let's load all of the book's authors and all of the author's personal contacts:

```js
const books = useRepo(Book).with('author', (query) => {
  query.with('contacts')
}).get()
```

Learn more about the constraining query in the next section.

### Constraining a Relationship Query

Sometimes you may wish to load a relationship, but also specify additional query conditions for the loading query. Here's an example:

```js
const users = useRepo(User).with('posts', (query) => {
  query.where('published', true)
}).get()
```

In this example, it will only load posts where the post's `published` filed matches the `true` first. You may call other query builder methods to further customize the loading operation:

```js
const users = useRepo(User).with('posts', (query) => {
  query.orderBy('createdAt', 'desc')
}).get()
```

### Lazy Relationship Loading

Sometimes you may need to load a relationship after the model has already been retrieved. For example, this may be useful if you need to decide whether to load related models dynamically. You may use the `load` method on a repository to load relationships on the fly in such a case.

```js
const userRepo = useRepo(User)

// Retrieve models without relationships.
const users = userRepo.all()

// Load relationships on the fly.
userRepo.with('posts').load(users)
```

You may set any additional query constraints as usual to the `with` method.

```js
userRepo.with('posts', (query) => {
  query.orderBy('createdAt', 'desc')
}).load(users)
```

Note that the `load` method will mutate the given models, therefore, it is advised to use the method within a single `computed` property.

```js
import { mapRepos } from 'pinia-orm'
import User from '@/models/User'

export default {
  data () {
    return {
      condition: false
    }
  },

  computed: {
    ...mapRepos({
      userRepo: User
    }),

    users () {
      const users = this.userRepo.all()

      if (this.condition) {
        this.userRepo.with('posts').load(users)
      }

      return users
    }
  }
}
```

### Loading All Relationships

To load all relationships, you may use the `withAll` and `withAllRecursive` methods.

The `withAll` method will load all model level relationships. Note that any constraints will be applied to all top-level relationships.

```js
// Fetch models with all top-level relationships.
useRepo(User).withAll().get()

// As above, with a constraint.
useRepo(User).withAll((query) => {
  // This constraint will apply to all of the relationship User has. For this
  // example, all relationship will be sorted by `createdAt` field.
  query.orderBy('createdAt')
}).get()
```

The `withAllRecursive` method will load all model level relationships and sub relationships recursively. By default, the maximum recursion depth is 3 when an argument is omitted.

```js
// Fetch models with relationships recursively.
useRepo(User).withAllRecursive().get()

// As above, limiting to 2 levels deep.
useRepo(User).withAllRecursive(2).get()
```

### Loading Nested Relationships

To load nested relationships, you may pass constraints to the 2nd argument. For example, let's load all of the book's authors and all of the author's personal contacts:

```js
const books = useRepo(Book).with('author', (query) => {
  query.with('contacts')
}).get()
```

## Inserting Relationships

You may use `save` method to save a record with its nested relationships to the store. When saving new records into the store via `save` method, Pinia ORM automatically normalizes and stores data that contains any nested relationships in it's data structure. For example, let's say you have the `User` model that has a relationship to the `Post` model:

```js
class User extends Model {
  static entity = 'users'

  static fields () {
    return {
      id: this.attr(null),
      name: this.string(''),
      posts: this.hasMany(Post, 'userId')
    }
  }
}
```

When you save a user record containing post records under the posts key, Pinia ORM decouples the user and post records before saving them to the store.

```js
// The user record.
const user = {
  id: 1,
  name: 'John Doe',
  posts: [
    { id: 1, userId: 1, title: '...' },
    { id: 2, userId: 1, title: '...' }
  ]
}

// Save the user record.
useRepo(User).save(user)

// The result inside the store.
{
  entities: {
    users: {
      1: { id: 1, name: 'John Doe' }
    },
    posts: {
      1: { id: 1, userId: 1, title: '...' },
      2: { id: 2, userId: 1, title: '...' }
    }
  }
}
```

Note that Pinia ORM automatically generates any missing foreign keys during the normalization process. In this example, the `Post` model has a foreign key of `userId` that corresponds to the `id` key of the `User` model. If you save post records without `userId`, it will still get populated:

```js
// The user record.
const user = {
  id: 1,
  name: 'John Doe',
  posts: [
    { id: 1, title: '...' }, // <- No foreign key.
    { id: 2, title: '...' }  // <- No foreign key.
  ]
}

// Save the user record.
useRepo(User).save(user)

// The result inside the store.
{
  entities: {
    users: {
      1: { id: 1, name: 'John Doe' }
    },
    posts: {
      1: { id: 1, userId: 1, title: '...' }, // Foreign key generated.
      2: { id: 2, userId: 1, title: '...' }  // Foreign key generated.
    }
  }
}
```

Depending on the relationship types, there may be a slight difference in behavior when inserting data. Please refer to the specific relationship type docs for more details.

## Updating Relationships

The `save` method also updates models that already exist in the store, including any nested relationships within the given records. Let's reuse our `User` and `Post` example:

```js
class User extends Model {
  static entity = 'users'

  static fields () {
    return {
      id: this.attr(null),
      name: this.string(''),
      posts: this.hasMany(Post, 'userId')
    }
  }
}
```

When you save the user record, relationships will be saved in a normalized form inside the store.

```js
// Existing data in the store.
{
  entities: {
    users: {
      1: { id: 1, name: 'John Doe' }
    },
    posts: {
      1: { id: 1, userId: 1, title: 'Title A' },
      2: { id: 2, userId: 1, title: 'Title B' }
    }
  }
}

// The user record.
const user = {
  id: 1,
  name: 'Jane Doe',
  posts: [
    { id: 1, userId: 1, title: 'Title C' },
    { id: 2, userId: 2, title: 'Title D' }
  ]
}

// Insert the user record.
useRepo(User).save(user)

// The result inside the store.
{
  entities: {
    users: {
      1: { id: 1, name: 'Jane Doe' } // <- Updated.
    },
    posts: {
      1: { id: 1, userId: 1, title: 'Title C' }, // <- Updated.
      2: { id: 2, userId: 1, title: 'Title D' }  // <- Updated.
    }
  }
}
```

## Deleting Relationships

If you delete a record then all relations with that record are staying untouched. But sometimes you want all
relations to be deleted with that record. 
Of course you could save the deleted record id and manually delete the related relations but you have also the option
to define through `onDelete` method the behaviour for relations on delete.
`onDelete` can have two options `cascade` and `set null`

````js
class User extends Model {
  static entity = 'users'

  static fields () {
    return {
      id: this.attr(null),
      number: this.string(''),
      // If this record is deleted all comments with that userId are also deleted
      comments: this.hasMany(Comment, 'userId').onDelete('cascade')
      // If you just want to lose the binding you can also define 'set null' 
      // comments: this.hasMany(Comment, 'userId').onDelete('set null')
    }
  }
}
````

There exist also a decorator `@OnDelete` for this
