Pinia ORM Axios adds supporting properties and methods to the `Model` object.

## Static Properties

### `axios`

- **Type**: `AxiosInstance | null`

  The axios instance which was either set during plugin installation or set using the [`setAxios`](#setaxios) method. Pinia ORM Axios will use this axios instance to perform requests.

### `apiConfig`

- **Type**: `Object`
- **Default**: `{}`

  The property that holds the model configuration for requests.

### `globalApiConfig`

- **Type**: `Object`

  The property that holds the global configuration. The value will be set automatically during the plugin installation process.

::: warning WARNING
Do not mutate this property programmatically.
:::

## Static Methods

### `api`

- `api(): Request`

  Return a newly created [Request](request) instance.

### `setAxios`

- `setAxios(axios: AxiosInstance): void`

  Set the axios instance manually. Typical setups will configure the axios instance during installation. However, in some cases (mostly with Nuxt), you may need to set the axios instance at a later stage.

  ::: warning IMPORTANT
  If you omit the axios instance during installation, it's important that one is set using `setAxios` before any attempt to make an API request.
