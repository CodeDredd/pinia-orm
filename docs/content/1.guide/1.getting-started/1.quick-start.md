  ## Prologue

  Note that in this documentation, we borrow many examples and texts from Vuex ORM Next. 
  We would like to credit [Vuex ORM Next](https://next.vuex-orm.org/) and the author of the section [Kia King Ishii](https://github.com/kiaking) for the beautiful work.

  This is a quick starting guide to begin using Pinia ORM. It assumes you have a basic understanding of Pinia. 
  If you are not familiar with Pinia, please visit the [Pinia Documentation](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) to learn more.

  ## Setup

  To setup Pinia ORM, you must:

  - Install Pinia ORM to Pinia.
  - Define Models.

  Don't worry. It's much easier than you think.

  ### Install Pinia ORM

  ::code-group
  ```bash [Yarn]
  yarn add pinia-orm
  ```
  ```bash [NPM]
  npm install pinia-orm --save
  ```
  ::

::alert{type="info"}
#### **Vite Integration**

Make sure to disable `useDefineForClassFields` in `tsconfig.json` when using `vite >= 2.5.0`. See [this issue](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/4636) for more details.

```json
...
"useDefineForClassFields": false,
...
```
::

  ### Adding the plugin to your pinia store

  ::code-group
  ```js{}[Vue3]
  import { createPinia } from 'pinia'
  import { createORM } from 'pinia-orm'

  const pinia = createPinia().use(createORM())
  ```
  ```js{}[Vue2]
  import { createPinia, PiniaVuePlugin } from 'pinia'
  import { createORM } from 'pinia-orm'

  Vue.use(PiniaVuePlugin)
  const pinia = createPinia().use(createORM())
  ```
  ::

  ### Define models

  Models represent a schema of data that will be stored in Pinia. The schema often follows a servers API response, but it could also be whatever you like it to be.
  
  Models may have relationships with other models. For example, a post could belong to a user, or a post has many comments.
  
  The following examples will demonstrate what these models may look like:

  **User Model**

  ::code-group
  ```ts{}[Fields Method]
  // User Model

  import { Model } from 'pinia-orm'
  
  export default class User extends Model {
    // entity is a required property for all models.
    static entity = 'users'
  
    // List of all fields (schema) of the post model. `this.string()` declares
    // a string field type with a default value as the first argument.
    // `this.uid()` declares a unique id if none provided.
    static fields () {
      return {
        id: this.uid(),
        name: this.string(''),
        email: this.string('')
      }
    }
    // For typescript support of the field include also the next lines
    id!: string
    name!: string
    email!: string
  }
  ```
  ```ts{}[Decorator Method]
  // User Model

  import { Model } from 'pinia-orm'
  import { Str, Uid } from 'pinia-orm/decorators'
  
  export default class User extends Model {
    // entity is a required property for all models.
    static entity = 'users'
  
    @Uid() id!: string
    @Str('') name!: string
    @Str('') email!: string
  }
  ```
  ::

  **Post Model**

  ::code-group
  ```ts{}[Fields Method]
  // Post Model

  import { Model } from 'pinia-orm'
  import User from './User'
  
  export default class Post extends Model {
    static entity = 'posts'
  
    // `this.belongsTo(...)` declares this post belongs to a user. The first
    // argument is the `User` model class. The second is the field name for
    // the foreign key `userId`.
    static fields () {
      return {
        id: this.uid(),
        userId: this.attr(null),
        title: this.string(''),
        body: this.string(''),
        published: this.boolean(false),
        author: this.belongsTo(User, 'userId')
      }
    }
    
    id!: string
    userId!: string | null
    title!: string
    body!: string
    published!: boolean
    author!: User | null
  }
  ```
  ```ts{}[Decorator Method]
  // Post Model

  import { Model } from 'pinia-orm'
  import { Attr, BelongsTo, Bool, Str, Uid } from 'pinia-orm/decorators'
  import User from './User'
  
  export default class Post extends Model {
    static entity = 'posts'
  
    @Uid() id!: string
    @Attr(null) userId!: string | null
    @Str('') title!: string
    @Str('') body!: string
    @Bool(false) published!: boolean
    @BelongsTo(() => User, 'userId') author!: User | null
  ```
  ::

  All models are declared by extending the Pinia ORM base Model class.
  
  These examples create a User model and a Post model. The Post model has a belongsTo relationship to User defined by the author key. It's now possible to create posts that are associated with users.
