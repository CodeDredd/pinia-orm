# Polymorphic

A polymorphic relationship is where a model can belong to more than one type of model on a single association.

## One To One

A one-to-one polymorphic relation is similar to a simple one-to-one relation; however, the target model can belong to more than one type of model on a single association. For example, an `Image` might be associated with a `User` or `Post` model.

### Defining A One To One Polymorphic Relationship

To define this relationship, for example, a `User` or `Post` model might be associated with one `Image`, we define a `morphOne` field to the `User` and `Post` models.

```js
class Image extends Model {
  static entity = 'images'

  static fields () {
    return {
      id: this.number(0),
      url: this.string(''),
      imageableId: this.number(0),
      imageableType: this.string(''),
    }
  }
}

class User extends Model {
  static entity = 'users'

  static fields () {
    return {
      id: this.number(0),
      name: this.string(''),
      image: this.morphOne(Image, 'imageableId', 'imageableType')
    }
  }
}

class Post extends Model {
  static entity = 'posts'

  static fields () {
    return {
      id: this.number(0),
      title: this.string(''),
      image: this.morphOne(Image, 'imageableId', 'imageableType')
    }
  }
}
```

The first argument passed to the `morphOne` method is the name of the model, the second argument is the name of the field which will contain the `id` of the model, and the third argument is the name of the field which will contain the `entity` of the parent model. The third argument is used to determine the "type" of the related parent model.

Additionally, Pinia ORM assumes that the foreign key should have a value matching the `id`
(or the custom `static primaryKey`) field of the parent. In other words, Pinia ORM will look for the value of the user's `id` field in the `imageableId` field of the `Image` record. If you would like the relationship to use a value other than `id`, you may pass a fourth argument to the `morphOne` method specifying your custom key:

```js
class User extends Model {
  static entity = 'users'

  static fields () {
    return {
      id: this.number(0),
      userId: this.string(''),
      name: this.string(''),
      image: this.morphOne(Image, 'imageableId', 'imageableType', 'userId')
    }
  }
}
```

### Defining The Inverse Of The Relationship

So, we can access the `Image` model from our `User` or `Post`. Now, let's define a relationship on the `Image` model that will let us access the model which owns the image. We can define the inverse of a `morphOne` relationship using the `morphTo` attribute:

```js
class Image extends Model {
  static entity = 'images'

  static fields () {
    return {
      id: this.number(0),
      url: this.string(''),
      imageableId: this.number(0),
      imageableType: this.string(''),
      imageable: this.morphTo(
        [User, Post],
        'imageableId',
        'imageableType'
      )
    }
  }
}
```

The first argument passed to the `morphTo` method is an array of models which are related, the second argument is the name of the field which will contain the `id` of the model, and the third argument is the name of the field which will contain the `entity` of the related model. The third argument is used to determine the "type" of the related model. You may also pass a fourth argument to the `morphTo` method specifying your custom key on the related model.

```js
class Image extends Model {
  static entity = 'images'

  static fields () {
    return {
      id: this.number(0),
      url: this.string(''),
      imageableId: this.number(0),
      imageableType: this.string(''),
      imageable: this.morphTo(
        [User, Post],
        'imageableId',
        'imageableType',
        'morphableId'
      )
    }
  }
}
```

## One To Many

A one-to-many polymorphic relation is similar to a simple one-to-many relation; however, the target model can belong to
more than one type of model on a single association. For example, a `Comment` might be associated with a `Post` or
`Video` model.

### Defining A One To Many Polymorphic Relationship

To define this relationship, for example, a `Post` or `Video` model might be associated with one or more `Comment`(s), we
define a `morphMany` field to the `Post` and `Video` models.

```js
class Comment extends Model {
  static entity = 'comments'
  static fields () {
    return {
      id: this.number(0),
      url: this.string(''),
      commentableId: this.number(0),
      commentableType: this.string(''),
    }
  }
}
class Video extends Model {
  static entity = 'videos'
  static fields () {
    return {
      id: this.number(0),
      link: this.string(''),
      comments: this.morphMany(Comment, 'commentableId', 'commentableType')
    }
  }
}
class Post extends Model {
  static entity = 'posts'
  static fields () {
    return {
      id: this.number(0),
      title: this.string(''),
      comments: this.morphMany(Comment, 'commentableId', 'commentableType')
    }
  }
}
```

The first argument passed to the `morphMany` method is the name of the model, the second argument is the name of the
field which will contain the `id` of the model, and the third argument is the name of the field which will contain the
`entity` of the parent model. The third argument is used to determine the "type" of the related parent model.

Additionally, Pinia ORM assumes that the foreign key should have a value matching the `id`
(or the custom `static primaryKey`) field of the parent. In other words, Pinia ORM will look for the value of the
video's `id` field in the `commentableId` field of the `Comment` record. If you would like the relationship to use a
value other than `id`, you may pass a fourth argument to the `morphMany` method specifying your custom key:

```js
class Video extends Model {
  static entity = 'videos'
  static fields () {
    return {
      id: this.number(0),
      videoId: this.string(''),
      link: this.string(''),
      comments: this.morphMany(Comment, 'commentableId', 'commentableType', 'videoId')
    }
  }
}
```

## Many To Many (Polymorphic)

In addition to traditional polymorphic relations, you may also define "many-to-many" polymorphic relations. For example, a blog Post and Video model could share a polymorphic relation to a Tag model. Using a many-to-many polymorphic relation allows you to have a single list of unique tags that are shared across blog posts and videos.

You can define many-to-many polymorphic relations by using the `this.morphToMany` attribute.

```js
class Post extends Model {
  static entity = 'posts'

  static fields () {
    return {
      id: this.attr(null),
      tags: this.morphToMany(Tag, Taggable, 'tag_id', 'taggable_id', 'taggable_type')
    }
  }
}

class Video extends Model {
  static entity = 'videos'

  static fields () {
    return {
      id: this.attr(null),
      tags: this.morphToMany(Tag, Taggable, 'tag_id', 'taggable_id', 'taggable_type')
    }
  }
}

class Tag extends Model {
  static entity = 'tags'

  static fields () {
    return {
      id: this.attr(null),
      name: this.attr('')
    }
  }
}

class Taggable extends Model {
  static entity = 'taggables'

  static fields () {
    return {
      id: this.attr(null),
      tag_id: this.attr(null),
      taggable_id: this.attr(null),
      taggable_type: this.attr(null)
    }
  }
}
```

### Defining The Inverse Of The Relationship

To define the inverse relation to fetch related record – for this example it's for Tag model – you can use the `this.morphedByMany()` attribute.

```js
class Tag extends Model {
  static entity = 'tags'

  static fields () {
    return {
      id: this.attr(null),
      name: this.attr(''),
      posts: this.morphedByMany(
        Post, Taggable, 'tag_id', 'taggable_id', 'taggable_type'
      ),
      videos: this.morphedByMany(
        Video, Taggable, 'tag_id', 'taggable_id', 'taggable_type'
      )
    }
  }
}
```

### Access Intermediate Model

As the same as `belongsToMany` relationship, you may access the intermediate model for polymorphic many-to-many relationship through `pivot` attribute on the model.

```js
const post = Post.query().with('tags').first()

post.tags.forEach((tag) => {
  console.log(tag.pivot)
})
```

Each `Tag` model we retrieve is automatically assigned a `pivot` attribute. This attribute contains a model representing the intermediate model and may be used like any other model.
