You may update existing data through various repository methods.

In this section, it assumes you're familiar with the usage of repository. If not, please read through the [Repository: Getting Started](./1.getting-started) page first.

## Updating Data

The `save` method may also be used to update models that already exist in the store. The `save` method will first attempt to locate a matching record using its primary key in the field and value pairs. If the record exists, it will be updated with the values in the other pairs.

```js
// Existing records.
[
  { id: 1, name: 'John Doe', age: 40 },
  { id: 2, name: 'Jane Doe', age: 30 },
  { id: 3, name: 'Johnny Doe', age: 20 }
]

// Update the "age" of the record with id of 2.
useRepo(User).save({ id: 2, age: 50 })

// The result.
[
  { id: 1, name: 'John Doe', age: 40 },
  { id: 2, name: 'Jane Doe', age: 50 }, // <- Updated.
  { id: 3, name: 'Johnny Doe', age: 20 }
]
```

You may pass an array of objects to update multiple records at once.

```js
useRepo(User).save([
  { id: 2, age: 50 },
  { id: 3, age: 80 }
])
```

The `save` method will also "normalize" the given data. That means if you pass an object that contains any nested relationships, those relationships are also updated. Please see [Relationships: Getting Started](../relationships/getting-started.md#inserting-relationships) for more details about data normalization.

## Constraints By Query

In addition to updating records by passing in the object that contains the primary key to the `save` method, you may constrain the query to control what records are to be updated by the `update` method and using a `where` clause.

```js
useRepo(User).where('id', 1).update({ age: 50 })
```

When constraining the query by the `where` clause, all updates will be performed against any number of records that match a given query.

In the following example, all flights that are `active` and have a destination of `Tokyo` will be marked as delayed:

```js
useRepo(Flight)
  .where('active', true)
  .where('destination', 'Tokyo')
  .update({ delayed: true })
```

As opposed to updating records by the `save` method, it only accepts an object as the argument (not an array). Also, it will not normalize the data, and any nested relationships will be ignored.
