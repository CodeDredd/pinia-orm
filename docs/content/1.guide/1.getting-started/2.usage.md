There is only one little difference between vuex-orm and pinia-orm-next usage. You need to use ``useRepo``

  ```js{}
  import User from './models/User'
  import { useRepo } from 'pinia-orm'

  const userRepo = useRepo(User)
  // Getting all users with their todos as relation
  const users = userRepo.with('todos').get()
  ```
